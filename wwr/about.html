                <p>White Water Rafting is not only an enjoyable thing to do, but it can also be very relaxing! Despite appearing fast-paced and nerve-wracking, you'll find that, more often than not, it brings you a sense of peace. There's something about being subject to nature and the rapids that calms the mind and helps you to feel relaxed, but also joyful - just like these people here! Give it a try today!</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Wild White Water Rafting has been around for almost 4 weeks, and are striving to provide you the best and most enjoyable experience they can. The idea for the company began in a school classroom, when an individual named Benton Hanson decided that he wanted to share his love of rafting with others. Now, the company has grown substantially, and many people have the ability to participate in our activities. We can now offer classes and training for all aspects of white water rafting, and are currently looking at creating more locations around the US.</p>
